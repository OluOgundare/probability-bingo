# Probability Bingo

## Overview
[From Brian Mehmed, 2011 WV APSI](http://noblestatman.com/uploads/6/6/7/3/66731677/probability_bingo.pdf)
Each of two die has colored faces, 3 green, 2 blue and 1 red. The two dice
will be rolled. The outcome will be considered to be one “bingo call.” If you
have this outcome on your bingo card, mark it off. The winner will be the
student who gets a bingo card completely marked off (all 25 squares). Mark
each square on your bingo card (use BG for “blue green,” BB for “blue
blue,” etc.) so that you have the best chance of winning.
