# Probability Bingo

## Overview
[From Brian Mehmed, 2011 WV APSI](http://noblestatman.com/uploads/6/6/7/3/66731677/probability_bingo.pdf) <br>
Each of two die has colored faces, 3 green, 2 blue and 1 red. The two dice
will be rolled. The outcome will be considered to be one “bingo call.” If you
have this outcome on your bingo card, mark it off. The winner will be the
student who gets a bingo card completely marked off (all 25 squares). Mark
each square on your bingo card (use BG for “blue green,” BB for “blue
blue,” etc.) so that you have the best chance of winning.

## Abstract
The game utilizes two dice, each with faces colored in three green, two blue, and one red. The outcome of rolling these dice is considered a "bingo call." The objective is to mark off each square on the bingo card (representing different color combinations like BG for blue-green, etc.) in a way that maximizes the likelihood of winning.

## Content Structure
Introduction: Lays the groundwork for the probability calculations used throughout the report.
1. 2x2 Bingo Board Analysis: Focuses on finding the optimal arrangement for a 2x2 bingo board, beginning with a detailed study of a 2x1 board configuration.
2. Dice Probabilities: Presents a comprehensive analysis of the probabilities associated with different color pairings on the dice.
3. Optimal Configurations: Discusses the best strategies for different board sizes (from 1x1 to 5x5), backed by probability calculations and simulations.
4. Python Simulations: Includes Python code used to simulate various scenarios and validate the theoretical findings.
5. Conclusion: Summarizes the findings and implications for strategy in probability-based bingo games.
